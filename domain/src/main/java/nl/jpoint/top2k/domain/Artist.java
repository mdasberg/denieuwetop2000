/**
 * An artist is generally a musician, group of musicians, a collaboration of multiple musicians or other music
 * professional contributing to the works described in the MusicBrainz Database. As the MusicBrainz project evolves,
 * so does the definition of "artist", so that now the artist table is used to hold everything up to music industry
 * lawyers (see Miscellaneous Production Relationship Type). In general, however, artists are people who sing or play
 * instruments.
